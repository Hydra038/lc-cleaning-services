## How It Works

### Admin Flow:

3. Updates PayPal email or bank account details
4. Enables/disables payment methods as needed

### Customer Flow:

2. Selects payment method (Step 3)
3. **Sees payment details automatically** (PayPal email or bank details)
4. Can make payment using displayed information
5. Receives booking confirmation

## Database Structure

Payment methods are stored in `payment_methods` table with:
```sql
{
  id: UUID,
  name: string,
  method_type: 'paypal' | 'bank_transfer',
  description: string,
  is_active: boolean,
  settings: {
    // For PayPal:
    paypal_email: string
    
    // For Bank Transfer:
    bank_name: string,
    account_name: string,
    sort_code: string,
    account_number: string
  }
}
```

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Currently, payment details are visible to all users. For production:
1. Consider adding authentication for admin panel
2. Implement proper RLS policies for sensitive data
3. Use environment variables for payment credentials
4. Add payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal API)

## Next Steps (Optional)

- [ ] Add admin authentication
- [ ] Integrate real payment gateways
- [ ] Add email notifications for bookings
- [ ] Implement booking confirmation via WhatsApp API
- [ ] Add invoice generation
- [ ] Export bookings to CSV/Excel
